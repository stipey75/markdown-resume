Dear Hiring Manger,

I am delighted to apply for this position in Blockstream. I have 20 years of experience in software/firmware development in embedded electronics: I started in the mobile phone industry as software developer and than developed my skills in other companies always related to embedded software development.

I discovered bitcoin in 2012 and I fell in love with all discussions on bitcointalk and still believe that crypto space have plenty of space of growth. I always followed in these years the incredible path of bitcoin and of many companies born on the top of it and it's still incredible in my eyes. Now I want to try to enter with my hands in these sector. I was hesitant to candidate in these years because I think that my experiences were not perfectly matching crypto space, but now I want to give myself an opportunity and surely Blockstream is a top notch opportunity. Just thinking that is leaded by Mr. Back gives me shivers.

What makes me think that I could be a good candidate for this position is that I always been a super curious and motivated developer. I worked in many sectors of electronics from mobile phone to consumer electronics boards and always developed in C/C++ now I fell in love with Rust and I want to make it my daily tool for working and keep growing my learning curve of this language at a fast pace.

I know that I am no more a young guy and this is a fact, surely you'll receive a lot of applications from younger candidates for this amazing position in Blockstream, but I think that my experience as a software developer could be a plus: I am confident with many tools, IDE, source control and bugtracking and I come from many years of teamworking with local and international teams. Beside tech skills I consider myself a humble and extroverted person, love to learn from other and expand my competences in every aspect of technologies. I love sports, cinema and good readings.

I really hope that you'll consider my application a give me a chance to have a call or a meeting with your team. It would be such an honor for me to have the opportunity to work in an amazing company like Blockstream and skyrocket my skills in crypto to the highest levels.

I look forward to hear some feedback from you and thanks for giving me the opportunity to apply for a position.

Sincerly,
Lucio Pinese
